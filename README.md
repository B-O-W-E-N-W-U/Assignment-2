# Neural-Network
An Adaptive ANN which suits any number of layer and node, support adam and SGD back propagation algorithm

The training inputs must be provided to the model in the form of column vectors, as well as the output. Then the model returns the predicted results in column vectors. The model supports regression and classification, and its performance measure is based on MSE. The classification tasks demonstrate how a csv file with labels is read and input to the ANN.
